Project Corsell - An Overview: 

1) Overall: 
This creation of this project began at Big Red Hacks 2018, a Cornell-based hackathon. Our goal was to create a 2nd-hand buying and selling platform on which students could find, buy, sell and sublet goods and housing conveniently. To date, no such service exists and is widely used on Campus. 

2) Build Status: 
The project is currently still undergoing work

3) Technologies: 
- Flask is used for a backend Web Dev framework
- The bulk of the styling is in HTML and CSS

Work on this project will continue over the next couple of months!
